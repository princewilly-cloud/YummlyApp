        description: `Founding father, mover, shaker, lover & dueling politico, Alexander Hamilton's 
        vision for America helped it to become the world's venue for opportunity and success. Washington DC's newest destination for music and entertainment 
        is dedicated to celebrating the talent and passion of America's best artists. 
        DC is a city where polish and sophistication have been charmed by a bohemian spirit creating a new thriving artistic underground. The Hamilton will offer local, national and international musicians the unique opportunity to entertain a city that is never short on opinions, all within earshot of The White House.`,

        review:[
        `This is a must eat place if you love French cuisine and you're visiting 
        Washington DC like us. The food, the atmosphere took us 
        right back to Paris :) Every dish was so good. 
        The truffle spaghetti was my daughter's most favorite dish in the city. 
        The beef tartare, onion soup were great appetizers and then the branzino and the 
        ravioli and warm shrimp salad were amazing as well. Highly Recommend!`
